# âœ… Review 3 â€“ End of Week 6: Logic & Integration Review

## Goals

- Confirm custom business logic correctness (pricing, date conflicts)
- Review use of @api.depends, computed fields, and cron jobs
- Evaluate quality and function of WhatsApp integration (via chosen API)
- Verify delivery logging and opt-in/opt-out handling
- Ensure logs are stored in an accessible format

---

## 1. Custom Business Logic

- **Pricing:**
  - Computed fields (`@api.depends`) for menu/service totals, VAT (15%), deposit (50%), and balance.
  - Ghana VAT is correctly applied.
  - Deposit auto-calculated.
- **Date Conflicts:**
  - `@api.constrains('event_date')` ensures bookings are only for future dates.
  - Guest count constraint prevents invalid bookings.
  - No direct logic for overlapping eventsâ€”consider adding venue/date conflict checks if needed.

## 2. @api.depends, Computed Fields, Cron Jobs

- **Computed Fields:**
  - Totals, deposit, and balance use `@api.depends` for real-time updates.
- **Cron Jobs:**
  - `_cron_send_event_reminders`: Sends WhatsApp reminders 24 hours before events.
  - `_cron_send_feedback_requests`: Requests feedback for completed events.
  - Both jobs use Odoo's scheduled task system and log failures.

## 3. WhatsApp Integration

- **API Usage:**
  - WhatsApp messages sent via `cater.whatsapp.service.send_message`.
  - Confirmation, reminders, and feedback requests are automated.
- **Quality:**
  - Message templates are clear and branded.
  - Error handling logs failures to Odoo logs.

## 4. Delivery Logging & Opt-In/Opt-Out

- **Logging:**
  - WhatsApp delivery status tracked with `whatsapp_sent` and `last_whatsapp_date`.
  - Errors are logged using Python's logging module (`_logger.error`).
- **Opt-In/Opt-Out:**
  - No explicit opt-in/opt-out logic for WhatsApp in current code.
  - Recommend adding a boolean field (e.g., `partner_id.whatsapp_opt_in`) and checking before sending messages.

## 5. Log Accessibility

- **Odoo Logs:**
  - All errors and delivery attempts are logged to Odoo's standard log files.
  - Accessible via `docker-compose logs web` or in Odoo's log directory.
- **Internal Chatter:**
  - Booking status changes and notifications are posted to the booking's message thread for auditability.

## ðŸŸ¢ Summary

- Business logic is robust and uses Odoo best practices.
- WhatsApp integration is functional and well-logged.
- Cron jobs automate reminders and feedback.
- Logging is accessible; opt-in/opt-out for WhatsApp should be added for compliance.

### Next Steps

- Add opt-in/opt-out for WhatsApp messaging.
- Consider logic for venue/date conflict prevention if required by business rules.
